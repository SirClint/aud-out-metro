## How to run the Metronome Application (for Gemini)

To run the metronome application, use the following command:

`/home/clinterrific/GitHub/aud-out-metro/venv/bin/python /home/clinterrific/GitHub/aud-out-metro/main.py`

This command ensures the application is executed using the Python interpreter within the virtual environment, which is necessary for its dependencies.
